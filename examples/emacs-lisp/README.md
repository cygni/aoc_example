# Emacs Lisp (elisp)
Emacs Lisp is a dialect of the Lisp programming language used as a scripting language by Emacs (a text editor family most commonly associated with GNU Emacs and XEmacs).
It is used for implementing most of the editing functionality built into Emacs, the remainder being written in C, as is the Lisp interpreter.
Emacs Lisp is also termed Elisp, although there is also an older, unrelated Lisp dialect with that name.

## How to build and run
Elisp is an interpreted language and therefore doesn't compile.
To evaluate your code, in your terminal, type `emacs --script aoc.el`.

## Docker
According to the [Cygni AoC procedure](https://github.com/cygni/aoc_example)
