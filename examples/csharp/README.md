# C# (.NET Core 5.0)
When Microsoft got into trouble for trying to take over Java (embrace and extend), they needed a new strategy for getting a "serious" language onto the Windows platform since Visual Basic was considered to be a bit of a toy. So C# came out looking almost identical to Java and James Gosling (creator of Java) said that "[C# is] sort of Java with reliability, productivity and security deleted." In return, Anders Hejlsberg (creator of C#) claimed that C# is much closer to C++ in its design and that the flaws of major modern languages (e.g. C++, Java, Delphi and Smalltalk) were the driving forces for creating the CLR and C# itself (fair enough, Java is also inspired by C++ and Smalltalk). Since 2005, Java and C# have diverged and become more different from each other. Ironically, Visual Basic is still the most productive language in .NET.
