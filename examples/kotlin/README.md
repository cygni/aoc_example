# Kotlin with gradle
Kotlin was designed to be a "better Java" and many who try Kotlin seem to get enthusiastic about it.

So far there doesn't seem to be a great movement towards it in the enterprise and ironically the major Kotlin app is an IDE for Java. When Oracle was battling Google over the "not-quite-java" on Android, Kotlin got a lucky political windfall when Google blessed Kotlin as a primary Android language and that seems to be where Kotlin is growing. Kotlin can also be used on iOS and on the javascript VM, although the libraries on each are different. Is that then still the same language or is it just more confusing?

Give it a try, maybe you'll be bitten by the bug!
